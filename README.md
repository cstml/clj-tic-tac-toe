# tic-tac-toe
## clj style

Good old Tic-Tac-Toe, a favourite of mine that I try and implement all
the time to test my understanding of new concepts. This was a fun
little project to implement in clojure. It is more of a stub than a
finalised project but nevertheless it works. There are still many
things left to be done on it ofc.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run with `lein run`. I am looking into
creating a  nix derivation  for it. If you just want to run it
download the `jar` file and run it locally with

```bash
   java -jar tic-tac-toe-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
```
